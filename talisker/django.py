# raven's django support does some very odd things.
# There is a module global, that is a proxy to the output of
# raven.contrib.django.models.get_client()
# But the only way you can customise the set up is via subclassing the client.
# So that's what we do. We ensure talisker's configuration, and hook it in to
# the other things that need to know about the client.  Django users just need
# to add the following to settings:
# SENTRY_CLIENT = 'talisker.django.SentryClient'
