0.7.1 (2016-11-09)
------------------

* remove use of future's import hooks, as they mess with raven's vendored imports
* slight tweak to logfmt serialisation, and update docs to match

0.7.0 (2016-11-03)
------------------

*Upgrading*

This release includes a couple of minor backwards incompatible changes:

1) access logs now use the talisker format, rather than CLF. See the docs for
   more info. If you are using access logs already, then the easiest upgrade
   path is to output the access logs to stderr (access_logfile="-"), and delete
   your old log files.

2) talisker no longer prefixes developer supplied tags with 'svc.'. This should
   only matter if you've already set up dashboards or similar with the old
   prefixed name, and you will need to remove the prefix

Changes:

  * access logs now `in logfmt
    <http://talisker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html#gunicorn-logs>`_
    rather than CLF

  * dummy statsd client is now useful `in testing
    <http://talisker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/statsd.html#testing>`_

  * logs are colored in development, to aid reading

  * the 'svc' prefix for tags has been removed

------------------

This allows consistant logging, making the choice in all cases that your
gunicorn logs go to the same stream as your other application log, making the
choice in all cases that your gunicorn logs go to the same stream as your other
application logs.

We issue a warning if the user tries to configure errorlog manually, as it
won't work as expected.
