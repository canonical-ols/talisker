# Developing on Talisker


First ensure dependencies are installed. For ubuntu/debian, the required
packages are in dependencies.txt:

    cat dependencies.txt | xargs sudo apt install -y

You also need to setup a db user accounts:

    sudo -u postgres make db-setup

Now you should be able to run the tests:

    make test

There are various test applications included too:

    make run     # basic wsgi app
    make flask   # flask app with db
    make django  # django app with db
    make celery-{worker,client}  # celery app, run each one in separate terminal
